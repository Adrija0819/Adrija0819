# 👋 Hi, I'm Adrija!
🎓 Junior at Penn State University, studying Electrical Engineering

💻 Currently a Platform Engineering Co-Op at IBM

🧶 I love to crochet! My most recent project is a blanket made using [willow squares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgpVRrcbTwA&t=919s&ab_channel=CrochetwithYarnhild) (my most recent obsession)

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis, predictive modeling, and hands-on engineering. I’m passionate about developing technology that advances healthcare (like humanoid robotics or disease prediciton and prevention) and creating renewable energy solutions (like geothermal systems). I’m big on continuous learning and taking initiative (ask me about growing my technical and leadership skills as a [Break Through Tech Fellow](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/)!).

Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science and cloud networks. I’m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals in either hardware or software development.

# Projects:
A few noteworthy projects I’ve worked on:

1. 🚀 **Autonomous Rover - Lunar Autonomy Challenge (NASA)** 🚀 

Virtually explored and mapped the lunar surface using a digital twin of NASA’s ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEX). Programmed a 4-wheeled robot with differential steering and 8 monochrome cameras to map a 9x9 m area within a total mission time of 1 hour.
* Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter, CARLA simulator
* Learnings: Utilizing autonomous agents in partnership with real-time data evaluation
  
2. 🧬**Neural Network Implementation using Keras - Break Through Tech (Cornell)** 🧬

Implemented a feedforward neural network model for a binary classification problem using the Keras Python package. Constructed, trained, and evaluated the neural network model's performance. Experimented with different hyperparameter values and neural network settings to retrain and evaluate the model's performance.
* Tech Stack: Python, Juptyer, Keras
* Learnings: machine learning, data visualization

3. 🔉 **Analog Audio Signal Chain PCB: System/Board Design & Characterization - Penn State University** 🔉

Designed and simulated a five-block analog audio system in NI Multisim—including the mixer, Baxandall tone-control, volume stage, LED-based level display, and output driver—using op-amp configurations to validate gain accuracy, filtering behavior, and power-rail stability across operating conditions. Debugged signal-chain faults after completing the full PCB design using oscilloscopes and frequency-response measurements, identifying issues such as EQ stage loading and summing-amp biasing.
* Tech Stack:  Oscilloscopes, signal generators, multimeters, DC power supplies
* Learnings: Breadboard design, PCB design, NI Multisim modeling, attenuation and signaling, audio mixing

4. 🚦**FPGA & Finite State Machine Design Project - Penn State University**🚦

Designed and simulated a finite state machine in Multisim, deriving logic equations and validating asynchronous and synchronous state-output behavior. Implemented the FSM using both FPGA-based logic (VHDL/Verilog-style reasoning) and discrete-logic realization on a breadboard with NAND gate ICs, programmable timers, LEDs, and tactile switches. Debugged clock-generation circuitry, asynchronous reset paths, and state-transition timing to ensure reliable and accurate hardware behavior. Utilized LabVIEW to implement a two-level nested switch-statement architecture that mirrored the FSM’s state and transition logic, reinforcing understanding of hardware-software co-design principles.
* Tech Stack: NI Multisim, LabVIEW, Verilog, MPLAB X
* Learnings: Breadboard design, Discrete Logic, FPGAs

5. ⚙️**Altium Designer PCB Development: Board Bring-Up, Layout Review & SI/PI Debugging - Penn State University**⚙️

Executed board bring-up, net-level debugging, and characterization of ADC/DAC interfaces, verifying signal integrity and power-distribution performance. Ran ERC/DRC validation, debugged grounding issues, and evaluated yield-impacting layout constraints such as track impedance and decoupling networks. Generated Gerber files and performed pre-fabrication review focusing on manufacturability and test coverage.
* Tech Stack: Altium
* Learnings: PCB design, net-level debugging, Gerber file development and construction
