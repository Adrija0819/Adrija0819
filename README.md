# 👋 Hi, I'm Adrija!
🎓 Junior at Penn State Univeristy, studying Electrical Engineering

💻 Currently a Platform Engineering Co-Op at IBM

🧶 I love to crochet! My most recent project is a blanket made using [willow squares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgpVRrcbTwA&t=919s&ab_channel=CrochetwithYarnhild) (my most recent obsession). 

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. I’m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a [Break Through Tech Fellow](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/)!) Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science and cloud networks. I’m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals in either hardware or software.


# ⚙️Tech Stack:

**Languages:** Python, Java, C, MatLab, G-Code, Verilog, LabVIEW

**Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplot

**Web Dev:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic)

**Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Git, GitHub, MARS 

# 🚀 Projects:
A few noteworthy projects I’ve worked on:

1. **Autonomous Rover - Lunar Autonomy Challenge (NASA)** 

Virtually explored and mapped the lunar surface using a digital twin of NASA’s ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEX). Programmed a 4-wheeled robot with differential steering and 8 monochrome cameras to map a 9x9 m area within a total mission time of 1 hour.
* Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter, CARLA simulator
* Learnings: Utilizing autonomous agents in partnership with real-time data evaluation
  
2. **Neural Network Implementation using Keras - Break Through Tech (Cornell)** 

Implemented a feedforward neural network model for a binary classification problem using the Keras Python package. Construct, trained, and evaluated the neural network model's performance. Experimented with different hyperparameter values and neural network settings to retrain and evaluate the model's performance.
* Tech Stack: Python, Juptyer, Keras
* Learnings: machine learning, data visualization
